Machine Learning techniques to predict a player's position based on his attributes. 

## About this Project

This project contains an analysis of players and prices of Fifa 20 Ultimate Team along with Machine Learning techniques to predict a player's position based on his attributes. 

## Getting Started

### Why? 

### Files

In the project directory, there are three files, two Jupyter notebooks, one for the Exploratory Data Analysis and one for the Machine Learning Models and, the Fifa 20 FUT dataset. 

### Running the code

To run this project you should have a local server running with Jupyter Notebook installed (you can use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))

The Jupyter notebook is filled with two types of cells, markdown and, code. To run the cells press shift + return and then check the results if there is any to be shown. 

You should download the dateset zip [file](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-ultimate-team-players-dataset) and use the code in the Jupyter notebook to unzip it. 

### Built With 

[Python Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
